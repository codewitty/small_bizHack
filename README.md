# small_bizHack

Code for the app we built for Small Business Hacks at Intuit in November 2018.

We built a web app called Lexii which is short for lexicographical.

The app helps users find relevant pictures to complement their written content.

The images are royalty free and are sourced from unsplashed.com, thus, users can get meaningful pictures to match the central ideas of their content.
