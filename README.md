# small_bizHack

Code for the app we built for Small Business Hacks at Intuit in November 2018.

We built a web app called Lexii which is short for lexicographical image finder.

The app analyzes the written content posted by users using NLP and helps users find relevant pictures to complement their content. 

The images are royalty free and are sourced from unsplashed.com, thus, users can get meaningful pictures to match the central ideas of their content.

All the users have to do is paste their content into the text box and the app provides the images found.
